Why I call this site ***earhe***:  
<br>

👂 *Ear* sounds almost exactly like *Yiyao* in Mandarin Chinese, so it’s totally fine if you just call me *Ear*. Many of my friends do. And now this site does, too.  
<br>
🎹 I started learning the piano and Latin dance at the age of four, and listening has always been an important way of experiencing the world for me. This site is mostly a visual collection of photos and notes, so adding *ear* into the URL felt like a small way to give sound a place here :)
