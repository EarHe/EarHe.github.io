Food is genuinely a big part in my life!  
<br>
🥯 In my free time, I love going out with friends to look for delicious food. I also enjoy cooking at home, especially baking.

👩‍🔬 I’m also curious about *what* and *how* we eat. That’s why I pursued a minor in *Food Science* at SJTU. Most of my evenings in my later undergraduate years were spent studying things like food chemistry and nutrition. (Yes, I’m the friend who reads ingredient lists for fun.)
