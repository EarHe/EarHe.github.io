I am an interdisciplinary researcher and performance producer from Shanghai, China. I critically examine how technology performs and how people perform technology through both live performance production and computational system prototypes.


My research primarily lies at the intersection of **Performance Studies** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, viewing interaction as a performative and dramaturgical process that structures collaboration between human and computational agents. 


My artistic practice centers on understanding interaction both within and beyond performance systems. I approach **management as a dramaturgy of performance**, a creative logic that composes relations among arts, technology, and society, revealing how systems themselves perform.


I received my **B.A. in Arts Management** from <span style="text-decoration: none;">[*Shanghai Theatre Academy*](https://en.sta.edu.cn)</span> and a **Bachelor-Minor Certificate in Science and Engineering** (Computer Science & Food Science) from <span style="text-decoration: none;">[*Shanghai Jiao Tong University*](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn)</span> in June 2024. I am currently pursuing a second **B.S. in Accounting** at <span style="text-decoration: none;">[*Beijing Normal University*](https://english.bnuzh.edu.cn)</span> to extend my dramaturgical thinking into the quantitative and systemic dimensions of production.
