authors: "Work in progress, in collaboration with <u>[Xiaosong Wu](https://bibs.bnu.edu.cn/en/faculty/full_time_faculty/0f0eb8bdcb85498fb5c500cfa83f6dcb.htm)</u> and <u>[Yun Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wangyun/)</u>."

abstract: "🤖 This work proposes a dramaturgical paradigm for Human-AI Interaction (HAI), reframing the **Human-Agent-Goal** relationship through the theatrical analogy of **Director-Actor-Script-Audience**. Building on the **Rehearsal-Performance** loop, we introduce an **Alignment-Action** model that redistributes autonomy across interaction phases and embeds reflection within the workflow."
