title: "🎭 Feeling Together Apart: Rethinking Audience Experience in Digital Theatre from the Perspective of Service Design"

abstract: "**Digital theatre** reorganizes spectatorship by replacing bodily co-presence with psychologically mediated forms of “***feeling together apart***.” Through Norman’s *visceral-behavioral-reflective* framework, the analysis reveals how **sensory interfaces** capture attention, how **platformized interaction** structures participation, and how **algorithmic retention** sediments viewing into long-term habits and identities. These layered mechanisms form a recursive affective regime that sustains shared presence without spatial proximity. The regime also feeds back into offline theatre, generating renewed modes of “***being together again***” and enabling emergent pathways toward transmedia storytelling within an expanding cross-media affective ecology."
