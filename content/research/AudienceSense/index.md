abstract: "**Audience data** in the performing arts industry is growing rapidly in volume and complexity, yet arts managers often lack accessible tools for extracting meaningful insights. To address this gap, we developed ***AudienceSense***, a lightweight analysis system that integrates **quantitative processing** with LLM-supported **qualitative interpretation**. The system employs a modular architecture combining standardized data cleaning, multi-dimensional statistics, visualization, and automated trend summarization powered by RAG-enabled information retrieval. Through iterative testing, ***AudienceSense*** demonstrated reliable performance and improved usability for **non-technical users**. This work illustrates a domain-specific, low-barrier approach to data storytelling and decision support, highlighting opportunities for future agentic extensions."
