title: Practice
description: >
  My artistic practice centers on understanding the **interaction both within and beyond performance systems**. The development of my practice unfolds along three interrelated trajectories. *First*, I deconstruct the internal mechanics of theatre by working within its infrastructural core as **Stage Manager** to understand how interactions onstage and backstage are scripted, timed, and collectively maintained. *Second*, I integrate these internal dynamics with broader social and institutional systems through my experience as **Producer**, translating artistic intent into institutional language and reconciling aesthetic form with economic and organizational frameworks. *Third*, I translate these systemic insights into the realm of **Computational System Design**, extending the logic of coordination and interaction from physical theatre into digital environments.
